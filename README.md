The NYC TLC (Taxi and Limousine Commission) project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about yellow taxi trips in New York City. The project utilizes various Python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy, for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Here's a overview of the project:

    Data Import: The project begins by importing the necessary libraries and reading the dataset from a CSV file using pandas. The dataset contains information about yellow taxi trips in 2017.

    Data Exploration: The initial exploration of the dataset involves examining the first 10 rows of data using the head() function. This provides a glimpse of the structure and content of the dataset.

    Data Summary: The next step involves obtaining an overview of the dataset using the shape attribute, which returns the number of rows and columns. Additionally, the info() function is used to obtain information about the data types of each column and the number of non-null values.

    Sorting Data: Two different columns, "trip_distance" and "total_amount," are sorted in descending order to identify the maximum values. This is done using the sort_values() function, which allows arranging the data based on specific column values.

Overall, the project aims to gain a basic understanding of the dataset by exploring its structure, examining data types, and sorting values based on specific columns. Further analysis and visualization can be performed based on this initial exploration to gain insights into the NYC yellow taxi trips dataset.
